# üöÄ DataScience‚ÄëFrom‚ÄëScratch

> My **daily learning journey** while completing the [GeeksforGeeks Data Science Course](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/ds-16?tab=Chapters).  
> I post **notes, code examples, and exercises** for each topic I learn.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Build a **strong foundation** in Python and Data Science  
- Solve **hands-on coding exercises** daily  
- Maintain a **clear, sharable log** of learning  
- Gradually create **mini-projects** using what I learn
